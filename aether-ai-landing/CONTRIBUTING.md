# Contributing to AetherAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AetherAI! To maintain code quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines.

## 🌿 Branch Naming Convention

We use a `type/description` convention for all branches.

- **feat/**: For new features (e.g., `feat/contact-form`)
- **fix/**: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix/footer-alignment`)
- **docs/**: For documentation changes (e.g., `docs/api-guide`)
- **refactor/**: For code refactoring without feature changes

## 📝 Commit Message Convention

We follow a simplified **Conventional Commits** approach. Please prefix your commit messages with the type of change:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation updates
- `style:` for visual changes and formatting
- `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature

Example: `feat: add contact section to landing page`

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository to your own account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aether-ai-landing.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Develop and check** your code:
   - Ensure the layout is responsive.
   - Run local tests (if any).
5. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive message"
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit your PR against the `main` branch.

## ✅ Validation Policy

- All Pull Requests must be reviewed by **at least one collaborator**.
- Ensure the code follows the existing style and design system.
- Once approved, the PR can be merged into `main`.
